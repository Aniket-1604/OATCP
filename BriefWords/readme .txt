Function briefWords: This function takes four parameters:
    str: The original word for which we want to generate short forms.
    s: The current subsequence being formed.
    i: The current index in the original word str.
    n: The remaining length of the subsequence to be formed.
    It returns a vector of strings containing all possible short forms of length n for the given word str.

Base cases:
    If n becomes 0, meaning the desired length of the subsequence has been reached, the current subsequence s is added to the result vector res.
    If i reaches the end of the word str, there are no more characters to consider, so an empty vector is returned.

Recursive steps:
    At each step, two recursive calls are made:
    One including the current character str[i] in the subsequence by calling briefWords with i + 1 and n - 1.
    Another excluding the current character by calling briefWords with i + 1 and n.
    The results of these recursive calls are concatenated and returned.
    
Main Function (main):
    It reads input from a file named "input2.txt" and writes output to a file named "output2.txt".
    It reads the number of words n from input.
    It initializes an empty set ss to keep track of unique short forms.
    It iterates n times, reading each word s from input.
    For each word s, it initializes an empty vector temp to store its short forms.
    It iterates from 1 to 4 (inclusive), calling the briefWords function to generate short forms of lengths 1 to 4.
    It ensures that each generated short form is unique by checking against the set ss.
    It adds unique short forms to the temp vector and inserts them into the set ss.
    After generating short forms for each word, it adds the temp vector to the ans vector of vectors.
    Finally, it prints the generated short forms for each word, separated by newlines, and writes the output to the file "output2.txt".
