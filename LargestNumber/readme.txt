Define Custom Comparison Function:

    We define a custom comparison function named compare.
    This function takes two strings a and b as input.
    It returns true if concatenating a and b forms a larger number than concatenating b and a.

Convert Numbers to Strings:

    For each number in the input vector nums, we convert it into a string.
    We store these string representations of numbers in a new vector named nums_str.

Sort Numbers:

    We sort the vector nums_str using the custom comparison function compare.
    This sorting order ensures that when concatenated, the numbers form the largest possible number.

Check for Leading Zeros:

    If the largest number after sorting is "0", it means all numbers in the input were zeroes.
    In this case, we directly return "0" as the result.

Concatenate Numbers:

    We concatenate all the sorted strings to form the result string.
    This result string represents the largest possible number that can be formed using the given input numbers.
