Initialization:
    Initialize sum, cnt, and i.
Main Loop:
    While sum is less than n:
        If nums[i] is less than or equal to sum + 1 and i is within the bounds of nums:
            Increment sum by nums[i] and move to the next element (i++).
        Else:
            Increment cnt.
            Double sum and add 1 to cover the missing number.
Termination:
    The loop ends when sum is equal to or greater than n.
Return Result:
    Return cnt, representing the minimum number of patches required.
