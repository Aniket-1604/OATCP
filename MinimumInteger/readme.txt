1. The algorithm utilizes a stack data structure to keep track of digits while iterating through the input number.
2. Iterate through each digit of the input number.
3. While iterating, compare the current digit with the top of the stack. If the current digit is smaller and there are remaining removals (k > 0), pop digits from the stack until either the stack is empty, the current digit is larger, or removals are exhausted.
4. After processing, push the current digit onto the stack.
5. After the iteration, if there are remaining removals (k > 0), remove digits from the end of the stack until the removals are exhausted.
6. Construct the result string from the digits remaining in the stack. Since the digits are stored in reverse order in the stack, reverse the order while constructing the result.
7. Remove any leading zeros from the result string.
8. If the resulting string is empty, return "0".
9. Return the final result string representing the smallest possible number after removing k digits.
